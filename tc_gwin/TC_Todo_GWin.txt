To do list - TC.GWin (MS Windows skin):

Bugs to be fixed
================
  - by resizing the window the vertical "lift" quits the bottom
  - crash after closing application (not a problem for users)
  - when two subwindows are open, swapping subwindows messes the "Window" an "Options" menus
    (issue seems tough; other applications using the GWindows framework haven't this problem:
     AZip, LEA or the mdi_example sample)

Improvements
============
- Tabs
- "Snap on / off" button
- Undo's (Ctrl-Z), Redo's (Ctrl-Y)
- show thick lines as thick
- Big cross cursor (optional)
- See size of pasted object when pointing left-bottom corner
- Rulers
- At most one instance of TC running on one PC
- Unicode - resistant (use GString of GWindows = String or Wide_String
  depending on the mode)

[For the GWindows framework]
- Internationalize MsgBox (Win32: MessageBoxEx)
