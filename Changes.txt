Major changes in TeXCAD
=======================

Version 4.3
===========
105:
- (Windows) Using Windows clipboard for copy/cut/paste
- (Windows) Using the mouse wheel for scrolling

Version 4.2
===========

099, Upload 14-Aug-2007:
- More refined algorithm to pick / unpick single objects: when the pointer touches several objects,
    at most one is considered at a time
- (Windows) Fixed case of non-maximized sub-windows: any new window, even on a next session,
    was invisible, making TC unusable without fiddling the registry!


096, 097, Upload 2-Feb-2007:
- TC.Output automatically chains epic's lines (\drawline, \dashline, \dottedline)
    whenever possible
- TC.Input treats H-Tabs as blanks, understands unary "+"
- TC.Input understands fully epic's \drawline (new), \dashline, \dottedline
    commands, also with N > 2 points, and the eepic \path command
- line "\usepackage{epic}" for LaTeX2e previewing (is \documentstyle[epic] in 2.09 mode)

095, Upload 14-Jan-2007:
- LaTeX code insertions for previewing (e.g. \usepackage, \renewcommand, \input, ...)
- Can select, instead of 2.09, LaTeX 2e for preview (now default) 
- Use of Unbounded_String's for options and figure contents -> no more limitation to 255 characters
- Backup of files (optional); original file only replaced when write successful
- (Windows) Saves default .sty switches

Version 4.1
===========

Upload 17-Apr-2004 & 1-May-2004
- changes an "anyline" to \line, \vector whenever possible
- changes a \line, \vector to "anyline" when it is so short that LaTeX outputs nothing
- (Windows) Display the delta-x,y of 2-point mousing operation

Upload 6-Mar-2004
- Line_setting across figure types with
  - thin / thick
  - plain / dotted / dashed
  - no arrow, 1 arrow, 2 arrows, arrow in middle
- some epic commands (\dottedline, \dashline)
- Testing I/O: entropy test across all ".sty" combinations

- (Windows) Toolbar for figures
- (Windows) Toolbar for line styles, choice of width, pattern, arrows
- (Windows) Preview files deleted when quitting TC


Version 4.0
===========

Upload 18-Jan-2004
- arrows displayed with correct size (4pt) (tc.display)
- oval corners with correct max radius (20pt) (tc.display)
- Set_slope_of_bezvec: fits arrow on curve or // tangent PE-PC in hard cases
- (Windows) Corrected bug of non-refreshing after text/oval/bezier changes
- TeX_Number fixed

Upload 17 & 14-Oct-2003
- (Windows) Corrected bug of non-refreshing after option changes
    (manual zoom, origin set), colours settings and deformations

Upload 21-Jun-2003
- (Windows) Double-buffering
- (Windows) Workaround for Windows 95 bug with hatches
- (Windows) Aspect ratio used
- (Windows) Minimal use of pen/brush/font creation (caused a leak under Windows 95/98/ME)
- TC.RW scissed into TC.Input and TC.Output

Upload 14-Jun-2003
- smallest output for floating-point values
- (Windows) filled figures displayed by hatches (allow overlapping with several colours)
- big \circle*s supported (filled fractally by boxes)

Upload 7-Jun-2003
- extra precision for small-scaled pictures
- {0.2} for \vector solved
- Good_Num_of_Bezier_points sensitive to paper size, not ul size 
- construction of lines of any slope with \line's sensitive to paper size, not ul size 

Upload 30-May-2003
- Homothethy (if hx/hy/=1 -> \line slope has image as "any_slope")
- text alignment influenced by Rotation & Symmetry


--------------------------------
Changes in ergonomy since v. 3.2
--------------------------------

If you are/were a TC 3.2 user, you'll notice that
when you pick objects, you cannot choose what you are picking.
As a counterbalance, you also can unpick individual objects,
and the algorithm for detecting proximity has been refined:
- frame of a non-filled box and its text (was the full one)
- shape of a non-filled circle (was the full one)
- Bezier curve (was only end points)

----------------------------------
Changes in the parser since v. 3.2
----------------------------------

- Bug with empty comments (lines with only "%") fixed

- GNUPlot LaTeX outputs are read. The parser recognizes:
  - "\setlength{\unitlength}{...}"
  - "\linethickness" inside a picture
  - optional y-offset in "\rule"
  - alternative unitlengths in "\rule" (converted into the
    main dimension)

- \qbezier with optional absence of [number of points] recognized
  (when that number is given, TC writes a \bezier for the sake
   of compatibility).

- numbers like ".123" accepted
- \framebox, \dashbox without [text] accepted
- \oval without options accepted
- \makebox without (0,0) accepted
- origin of picture is read
