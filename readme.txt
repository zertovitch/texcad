TeXCAD
------

  TeXCAD is a program for drawing or retouching {picture}s in LaTeX.
  The features of environment {picture} are quite limited, but it
  presents the great advantage of requiring *no* add-on and being
  displayed on *all* devices.
  You also enjoy the same fonts, macros, formulas as elsewhere
  in your LaTeX document. 
  In addition TeXCAD extends the original {picture} capabilities.
