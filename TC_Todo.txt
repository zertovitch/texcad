To do list - TC:

Bugs to be fixed
================
  - tiny loss of precision in web033.tcp
  - support this (written by some program using eepic):
    \SetFigFont{12}{14.4}{\rmdefault}{\mddefault}{\updefault}

  - support (some of) eepic at least for input
	\spline(x1,y1)(x2,y2)...(xn,yn)
	\ellipse{x-diameter}{y-diameter}
	\ellipse*{x-diameter}{y-diameter}
	\arc{diameter}{start-angle}{end-angle}
	

  - bezier arrow tips seem a bit misplaced (yap: [y] dviwin: [] pdf: [y])
    a solution: make the curve slightly shorter

Improvements
============
  - anchors on selected objects for direct modifications
  - arcs
  - ellipses
  - dashes: display of stretch, output emulated with \multiput
  - individual \linethickness or \linewidth
  - \multiput, \shortstack
  - Unicode available ? (a TString subtype of String or Wide_String)
  - linked items (maybe <-> nested {picture}s)
  - grouped / nested {picture}s (maybe <-> linked items)
  - Undo & Redo system
  - parametric curves
  - some of these extensions supported by GNUPlot:

  	  epslatex	LaTeX (Text) and encapsulated PostScript
  	  pslatex		LaTeX picture environment with PostScript \specials
